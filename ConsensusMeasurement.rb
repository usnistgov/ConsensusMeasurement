  Notes relevant to all of the methods that follow below

  The paper "Measuring social consensus" identifies four ways of setting the
  effective population size:
  P(1)  The nominal size of the voting body
  P(2)  The current size of the voting body with vacant positions excluded
  P(3)  The number of members present at the time of voting
  P(4)  The number of members that did not abstain
  Abstention = present but not voting.

  And it identifies two types of quorums:
  (1)  A minimum number of members that must be present at the time of voting
  (2)  A minimum number of members that must not abstain
  With the added condition that you are never quorate if nobody votes.

  Quorum type (1) can be specified as a constant or it can be derived as a
  proportion of P(1) or P(2).  Quorum type (2) can be specified as a constant
  or it can be derived as a proportion of P(1), P(2), or P(3).  Note that the
  effective population size used for quorum purposes need not be the same as
  is used for determining consensus.

  The methods below don't take the nominal or current size of the voting body
  as parameters.  If the quorum is specified as a proportion of P(1) or P(2),
  the caller must reduce it to the number of members and specify quorum_type
  :num_present or :num_voting as applicable.  For example, if quorum is
  defined as 1/3 of P, Rational(P,3).ceil should be passed as the value for
  quorum.

  The remaining option is quorum type (2) defined as a proportion of P(3).
  This is supported by specifying quorum_type :proportion_voting and passing
  the proportion as a Rational value for quorum.

  Thus, the parameters related to the determination of quorum are:
  quorum_type         :num_present, :num_voting, or :proportion_voting
  quorum              Integer ≥ 1 (:num_present and :num_voting)
                      Rational, 0 < proportion ≤ 1 (:proportion_voting)
  present and voting  Integer ≥ 0, present ≥ voting

  "Measuring social consensus" also identifies four ways of setting the
  threshold for determining consensus.  Let P be the effective population
  size and let V be the number of votes in favor of some choice (0 ≤ V ≤ P):
  Majority        V > P/2
  Supermajority   V ≥ TP with 1/2 < T ≤ 1
  Near-unanimity  V ≥ P−C with 0 ≤ C < P/2
  Unanimity       V = P

  All options for determining consensus are supported by the following
  parameters:
  population      Integer P ≥ 0
  threshold_type  :majority, :supermajority, :near_unanimity, or :unanimity
  threshold       For :near_unanimity, Integer 0 ≤ C < P/2
                  For :supermajority, Rational 1/2 < T ≤ 1
                  Optional and ignored for :majority and :unanimity

  Various constraints are enforced as feasible given the other data provided
  to the different methods; for example, for a yes/no question or 1-of-M
  contest, the total number of votes cannot exceed the number of members
  present.

  The value of present (used for quorum) can exceed the value of population
  (used for consensus) when P(4) the number of members that did not abstain
  is used as the effective population size for determination of consensus.
